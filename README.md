# LLaMA-Math: Quantized Optimization of Mathematical Reasoning

This repo supports the paper *Quantized Optimization of Mathematical Reasoning*, where we explore how Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can be used to fine-tune the LLaMA model. We test whether GRPO can improve LLaMA's performance at solving Humanityâ€™s Last Exam (HLE) problems.
