# Grouped Relative Policy Optimization for Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA: An Empirical Study

This repo supports the paper *Grouped Relative Policy Optimization for Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA: An Empirical Study*, where we explore how Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can be used to fine-tune the LLaMA algorithm. We test whether GRPO can improve LLAMA's performance at solving Humanityâ€™s Last Exam (HLE) problems.
